* Switching from the romance of science to the uninspiring pursuits of the industry - I left the mysteries of the brain to work on improving sales calls?
* Getting over the idea that personal connection to the product is what matters (as opposed to the day-to-day parameters of people, technology, projects, commute etc.)
* Industry has the advantage over academy that there is enough out there even though you can't get everything you want, you can choose what to prioritize.
* Beware the cheerleading choir: "you're so smart and talented, you'll be snatched up". It's not so easy (especially given the high expectations that you must have).
* Team leader Interviewers look for a contributing member of their team, not someone who can replace them one day. Many of our great soft skills will carry us up sooner or later but they're largely irrelevant for that landing that first job (thanks to Michel for this tip).
* Be precise about how you frame yourself. Don't end up seeming overqualified for a data science role and underqualified for a research role, etc. Address your interviewer's hesitation about you being a PhD.
* My pros and cons for this decision were...
* Other tips like practice for interviews and do a lot of them, deciding what is important for you in a workplaces, etc. etc....: Not the idea of this post. Plenty of other places to look.
* Have confidence about your skills as a PhD - you've learnt a lot of useful ones!
* But don't be over-confident. You have a lot to learn from much younger and less "educated" people and they may be better qualified than you for certain roles.
