My research at Leon Deouell's [Human Cognitive Neuroscience Lab](https://www.hcnl.org/) was about how the human visual cortex represents visual stimuli over sustained periods of time. The links below contain a selection of guides, tools, functions and analysis pipelines that I developed over the course of my PhD.

My complete guide to analyzing and visualizing fMRI data using FreeSurfer and FSFast (with analysis pipeline code template).

## Functions for time series analysis and statistics (MATLAB)
[![img](../assets/images/neuro/eeg_analysis_header.png)](/eeg_functions/)
A wide array of Matlab functions, focused on EEG analysis but should be widely applicable. Include functions for plotting, testing, manipulating and generating data.

## ECoG/fMRI visualization and data plotting toolbox (MATLAB)
[![img](../assets/images/neuro/vis_toolbox_header.png)](/vis_toolbox/)
Toolbox for visualizing 3D brain models in Matlab, as well as to flexibly plot data on and around the brain surfaces.
