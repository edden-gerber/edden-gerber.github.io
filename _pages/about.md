Pursuing a new career in data science after a neuroscience PhD at [ELSC](https://elsc.huji.ac.il/).

I studied visual information processing in the human brain using EEG, intracranial EEG and fMRI, and applying statistical, machine learning and time series analysis tools. Though I very much enjoy pure research, I felt the academic path was too lacking in opportunities to actually build things that work and that are useful to people - opportunities that I found in data science.

This website is then dedicated to useful things: guides, toolboxes, and scripts from my PhD work; and new ideas, projects and insights that I come across in my new path.

You are welcome to write me with questions, requests and employment opportunities using the links on the left.
