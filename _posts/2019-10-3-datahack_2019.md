### My first hackathon
A few weeks ago I had a chance to participate in my first data science hackathon - [Datahack 2019](https://www.datahack.org.il/), which took place in Jerusalem. I joined a good friend and previous graduate of my lab as the final member of a team incidentally composed almost entirely of neuro/biology PhD graduates, and we signed up for the ["devices gone rogue" anomaly detection challenge](https://www.datahack.org.il/challenge/armis-devices-gone-rogue) presented by [Armis](https://www.armis.com/).

With two free days before the event that I could spend studying ahead, I came very prepared having read anything that I could find about common approaches to anomaly detection problems and with a few ideas of my own. The event itself was a great deal of fun, I got to know some wonderful teammates and we eventually ended up on the 2nd place for this challenge.

### The devices-gone-rogue challenge

Armis's product is an IoT security platform, that identifies threats coming from any type of device in an organization's network (phones, printers, smart televisions, vehicles, medical instruments, etc.). Appropriately, the [challenge](https://github.com/armis-security/DataHack2019) presented in the Datahack was to determine, based on a large database of network traffic events, devices with suspicious (i.e., anomalous) behavior.

Our team's solution, along with explanation and even a PPT presentation, is available on github: https://github.com/YG15/DataHack2019 (credit due to my team members Tali Shrem, Guy Sheffer, Yonathan Guttel, Inbal Meir and myself).

On a similar note, the 1st place solution can be found [here](https://github.com/dmarcous/Self-Supervised-Network-Anomaly-Detection?fbclid=IwAR02I0JsfydDS1ud7uHezbw9CbwZWBNROpRTlmY54os0bEmDtV0daw2dfa0). Achieving an area-under-the-ROC-curve of ~0.9 compared to our 0.87, it is a great deal more complex and incorporates domain-expertise-based feature engineering and model ensembling. It's worth a look.
